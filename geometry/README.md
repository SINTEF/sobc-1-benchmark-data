# SOBC-1 Geometry files

This folder contains files describing the geometry of SOBC-1. There are multiple files, split into different folders. An overview is given below:

- **A fully assembled ship** can be found the file `SOBC-1_Ship-Assembly.3dm` withing the `assembled ship` folder. It contains a 3D model of the SOBC-1 in Rhinoceros format, which contains all geometry parts.

- **Files describing the hull geometry** is located in the `hull` folder. This includes line drawings and CAD models in both `.igs` and `.step` format. 

- **Files describing the rudder geometry** is located in the `rudder` folder. This includes CAD files in both `.igs` and `.step` format for the rudder itself, the headbox and the shaft.

- **Files describing the propeller geometry** is located in the `propeller` folder. This includes CAD files in both `.igs` and `.step` format of both a single blade, all four blades together, and the hub. 

## Coordinate system
Cartesian coordinate system, with origin at the aft perpendicular (AP) and bottom of the ship (Base). The x-axis is positive forward, the y-axis is positive portside, and the z-axis is positive upward.

All geometry parts are defined in this coordinate system.
