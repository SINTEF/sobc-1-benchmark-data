# SOBC-1 Benchmark Data

This repository contains data for the **SINTEF Ocean Bulk Carrier 1** (SOBC-1), an open ship geometry used for various projects internally at [SINTEF Ocean](https://www.sintef.no/sintef-ocean/) and made available for other researchers interested in ship hydrodynamics. 

There are some terms and conditions for this data. Please read the [Data Use Agreement](DATA_USE_AGREEMENT.md) carefully before using it.

## Repository structure

Three types of data are stored on this repository. 

First, geometry data for the SOBC-1 is shared in the form of CAD files. This is, for instance, useful if you want to use this ship in some simulation, such as CFD. All geometry data for the ship can be found in the folder `geometry`.

Second, we will share results and data from the experiments we conduct using the SOBC-1 in our [hydrodynamic laboratories](https://www.sintef.no/sintef-ocean/laboratorier/). These results can be found in the `experimental results` folder.

Third, we have shared some photos of SOBC-1 in the `media` folder. This is mainly for illustrative purposes. An example can be seen below:

To get an overview of the background of the SOBC-1, you can read the report located [here](SO_Benchmark_Bulk_Carrier_SOBC-1_VKr_ICN-Meeting-030522.pdf)

## Publications using the SOBC-1

The SOBC-1 is heavily used within projects at SINTEF Ocean, and therefore also in scientific publications. Below is a (*possible non-exhaustive*) list of publications made so far.
