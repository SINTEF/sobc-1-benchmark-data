# SOBC-1 Benchmark Data

This repository contains data for the **SINTEF Ocean Bulk Carrier 1** (SOBC-1), an open ship geometry used for various projects internally at [SINTEF Ocean](https://www.sintef.no/sintef-ocean/) and made available for other researchers interested in ship hydrodynamics. 

There are some terms and conditions for this data. Please read the [Data Use Agreement](DATA_USE_AGREEMENT.md) carefully before using it.

## Repository structure

Two types of data are stored on this repository. 

First, geometry data for the SOBC-1 is shared in the form of CAD files. This is, for instance, useful if you want to use this ship in some simulation, such as CFD. All geometry data for the ship can be found in the folder `geometry`.

Second, we will share results and data from the experiments we conduct using the SOBC-1 in our [hydrodyanmic laboratories](https://www.sintef.no/sintef-ocean/laboratorier/). These results can be found in the `experimental results` folder.

## Publications using the SOBC-1

The SOBC-1 is heavily used within projects at SINTEF Ocean, and therefore also in scientific publications. Below is a (*possible non-exhaustive*) list of publications made so far. 

- Sauder, T., Alterskjær, S.A., 2022, *Hydrodynamic testing of wind-assisted cargo ships using a cyber–physical method*. Ocean Engineering, Volume 234. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2021.110206)

- Johannessen, J.T., Sileo, L., Koushan, K., Krasilnikov, V., Froitzheim, S., Schulze, R., 2024, *Numerical and experimental study of a series of contrarotating propellers*. Eighth International Symposium on Marine Propulsors, Berling, Gerimany. [Link](https://d-nb.info/132802640X/34)
