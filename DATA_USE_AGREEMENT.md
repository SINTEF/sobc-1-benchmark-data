# Data Use Agreement for SOBC-1 Benchmark Dataset

## Purpose
This Agreement concerns the provision and use of data regarding the benchmark dataset *SINTEF Ocean Bulk Carrier SOBC-1*, which SINTEF Ocean developed. By downloading and using the data, you are entering into an Agreement, specified in this document, that regulates how the data can be used. SINTEF Ocean provides this data for the purpose of validating numerical methods and tools, comparing results, and conducting research.

## Definitions

*Data Recipient* is in this Agreement defined as any user who downloads data from SINTEF Ocean concerning the research vessel SOBC-1

*Data Sharing Platform* is in this Agreement defined as the web site where SINTEF Ocean distributes the SOBC-1 Benchmark Dataset. The web site is currently hosted on Github, with the URL [https://github.com/SINTEF/sobc-1-benchmark-data](https://github.com/SINTEF/sobc-1-benchmark-data).

## Authority and data ownership

SINTEF Ocean is an independent legal entity registered with the business enterprise organization number NO 937 357 370. SINTEF Ocean permits the use of data regarding the SOBC-1 benchmark dataset for non-commercial, research and educational activities. SINTEF Ocean will remain the sole owner of all geometrical data as well as experimental and numerical results produced by SINTEF Ocean and provided with the present dataset.

## Terms and conditions

All data regarding the SOBC-1 benchmark dataset are exclusively distributed by SINTEF Ocean via a dedicated Data Sharing Platform. The link to this platform is provided by SINTEF Ocean.
 
The dataset can be used for non-commercial activities, including, for example, the development and validation of numerical simulation methods, comparative studies, design approaches, etc., in the field of research and education.

SINTEF Ocean can provide technical assistance regarding obtaining and interpreting the data upon request should such a need arise. 

The Data Recipient shall acknowledge the origin and authorship of the SOBC-1 benchmark dataset and provide an appropriate reference in all their publications and presentations where the present dataset is used, as a whole or in part, as detailed in the section *Publication/Disclosure rules*.

## Data elements 

This agreement applies to all data shared by SINTEF Ocean concerning the SOBC-1 on the Data Sharing Platform. SINTEF Ocean will, at all times, have the right to choose what data is shared. The dataset is expected to be dynamic, with more data added in the future. Data about SOBC-1 that is not shared on the Data Sharing Platform is not covered by this Agreement.

## Ownership of developed Intellectual Property

The knowledge and results (for example, an improved numerical method or simulation setup, results of comparative calculations, etc.) developed by the Data Recipient as a result of using the SOBC-1 benchmark dataset shall remain the property of the Data Recipient. 

## Publication/Disclosure rules
The design data and experimental results regarding the original SOBC-1 vessel (Design-1) are open to the public and can, therefore, be reproduced in publications by the Data Recipient. The Data Recipient agrees to acknowledge in all publications and presentations the origin and authorship of the SOBC-1 benchmark dataset as those by SINTEF Ocean, and use the following reference for this purpose: 

*Krasilnikov, V.I. (2022): SINTEF Ocean Benchmark Bulk Carrier SOBC-1, Presentation at the 1st Meeting of the International Collaboration Network in Marine Technology, Trondheim, Norway, May 03, 2022 (virtual event).*

The Data Recipient shall not change the name of the original dataset as referred to in their publications. SINTEF Ocean Bulk Carrier SOBC-1, or its abbreviation SOBC-1, are the only recognized dataset names.

The Data Recipient agrees to provide SINTEF Ocean with an advance copy of any publication resulting from the use of the SOBC-1 benchmark dataset not less than two weeks prior to the submission or disclosure of publication, to permit SINTEF Ocean to reasonably comment, update or otherwise propose modifications or edits to the draft publication and ensure that the dataset is appropriately used, and its origin is acknowledged. If SINTEF Ocean does not respond to the Data Recipient's submission of materials for review within two weeks, the Data Recipient may proceed to publish or present these materials. 

As the distribution of the SOBC-1 benchmark dataset is performed solely by SINTEF Ocean (see article *Term and conditions*), any transfer of data elements, as a whole or in part, to a third party, including the Data Recipient's affiliated entities, can only be done by the Data Recipient under the provision of having a separate explicit agreement from SINTEF Ocean.

## Duration, amendments and modifications

This Agreement is effective when the Data Recipient downloads data from the Data Sharing Platform. 

This Agreement concerning the present SOBC-1 benchmark dataset is perpetual. Further development of the SOBC-1 dataset by SINTEF Ocean may result in new data being available and, hence, amendments or modifications of the present Agreement. Such amendments or modifications will not affect the rules regarding the use of data distributed under the present Agreement.
