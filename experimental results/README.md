# Experimental results

This folder contains experimental results from hydrodynamic tests done with the SOBC-1. The results are sorted on individual test campaigns, located in different folders. Below is a short overview of the content in each folder. This folder will be updated with new results when they are ready.

- `2021 - calm water resistance and propulsion` contains results from the first tests done on SOBC-1 to asses the calm water resistance and propulsion characteristics. The data is delivered in the form of a PDF document, which also contains a description of the tests that where performed. 
- **Work in progress** `2024 - turning circles in calm water and waves` contains results from several turning circle tests done in an ocean basin, in both calm water and with different regular waves. The data is delivered as several `.csv` files with time series of the measured quantities during the tests.
